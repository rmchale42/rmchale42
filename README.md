- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rmchale42
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as possible about the world of tech. I recently earned the CompTIA A+ certication and plan to pursue other certifications as
well. I have also dedicated a lot of time recently to learning how to program. I am really enjoying all of this, and feel really enthusiastic about continuing to grow
in the field.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of web development. I'm primarily working with , HTML, CSS, and Javascript at the moment, but I have some experience with 
PHP. I am planning on continuing to branch out into new languages as I progress, but am focusing on becoming proficient in this area for now.
